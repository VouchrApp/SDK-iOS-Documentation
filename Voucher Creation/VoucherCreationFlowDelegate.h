@brief This delegate method is called if payment information needs to be provided to complete activation of the voucher. The callback occurs when the user hits send on the summary screen or if the user taps on the credit card cell.
 
@remark If no paymentInfo needs to be provided, execute the completion block with a nil payment.
@remark The contents of the paymentInfo dictionary will be dependent on the payment system being used and will require discussion with backend team.
 
@property viewController - the current top viewController. If a paymentViewController needs to be presented to retrieve additional payment information, it should be presented on this viewController.
@property voucher - The voucher that needs the payment information.
@property completion - Completion block to be executed when the payment information has been obtained. Supply a dictionary with payment info as the paymentInfo. This will be used in the activateVoucher call. Supply an error if an error has occurred, or if the payment could not be completed.

 @brief This delegate method is called when the default summary screen is displayed to the user.

 If this method is not implemented, or if nil is returned, it will use the default data sources:
 1) SummaryScreenClaimerInfoDataSource
     - shows who the gift is being sent to (if there is one)
     - shows when the gift is claimable
 2) SummaryScreenPriceDataSource
     - shows the gift card envelope
     - shows the amount, fees and total cost
     - shows any credits used (if any were used)
     - shows who the gift is visible to
 3) SummaryScreenPaymentDataSource
     - shows which credit card will be used (last 4 digits and type of card) if a credit card is provided
 4) SummaryScreenEndInfoDataSource
     - shows where the receipt is being emailed to
     - shows legal disclaimerText if any is in the Voucher
     - shows terms and conditions if any is in the Voucher
     - shows cardHolderAgreementUrl if one is in the Voucher
